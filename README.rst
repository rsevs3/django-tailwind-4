.. note::
   This is a maintained fork of Tim Kamanin's original django-tailwind project. The original project is no longer maintained. This fork updates the project to work with the latest version of Tailwind CSS while preserving the original functionality.

Goal
====

This project aims to provide a comfortable way of using the *Tailwind CSS* framework within a Django project.

Features
========

* An opinionated *Tailwind CSS* setup that makes your life easier;
* Hot reloading of CSS, configuration files, and *Django* templates. No more manual page refreshes!
* Out of the box support for CSS imports, SASS-like variables, and nesting;
* Includes official *Tailwind CSS* plugins like *typography*, *form*, *line-clamp*, and *aspect-ratio*;
* Supports the latest *Tailwind CSS* `v4.x`;

For instructions on upgrading from ``v2`` to ``v3``, see this post on `Tim Kamanin's blog <https://timonweb.com/django/django-tailwind-with-support-for-the-latest-tailwind-css-v3-is-out>`_.

Requirements
============

Python 3.10 or newer with Django >= 3.2 or newer.

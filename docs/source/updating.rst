Updating Tailwind CSS and its Dependencies
==========================================

When a new release of Tailwind CSS comes out, you can update your theme project without updating Django Tailwind.

Checking if there are updates for Tailwind CSS and its dependencies
===================================================================

Before doing an update, you can check if there are any updates. Run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py tailwind check-updates

This command runs the ``npm outdated`` command behind the scenes in the context of your ``theme/static_src`` directory.

If there are updates, you’ll see a table of dependencies with the latest compatible versions. If there are no updates, this command will return no output.

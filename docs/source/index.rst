===========================================
Welcome to Django Tailwindâ€™s documentation!
===========================================

Definitions
===========

This document uses the Tailwind word when we talk about two things: the CSS framework and the Django package.

So letâ€™s agree that weâ€™ll use:

* **Django Tailwind**, when we talk about this very package;
* **Tailwind CSS**, when we talk about the CSS framework;

So **Django Tailwind** was created to make **Tailwind CSS** and Django play together (ðŸ’š).
